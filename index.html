    <h2 class="light-text"><em>Permanent Change of Station</em></h2>
    <p>PCS is the official relocation of an active duty military service member – along with any family members living with him or her – to a different duty location, such as a military base.It is known to be a stressful time for a military family.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><u>Tips to lighten PCS</u></p>
    <ol>
    <li>Create a personal moving calendar with checklists, phone numbers and links to critical moving processes and information</li>
    <li>Your Transportation Office (TO) or Personal Property Shipping Office (PPSO) is the primary point of contact for customer service. It is never too early to ask questions</li>
    <li>Once you get your orders and know the dates you want to move, immediately start the moving process. Contact your TO/PPSO to learn all options available to you, including a Personally Procured Move. The sooner you start the better chance you have to lock in your preferred move date.</li>
    </ol>
